# Bears-UFO-Plots
Project using Matplotlib to visualize UFO Sightings data

# Main Stories
- As a Data Analyst, I want to set up the proper imports so I have access to the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries
- As a Data Analyst, I want to import and store the ufo_sightings.csv file in a variable
- As a Data Analyst, I want to ensure my DataFrame is cleaned by removing any null values
- As a Data Analyst, I want to filter my DataFrame to remove any information that is not related to my analysis
    This will include dropping the Described_Duration, Description, and Date_Documented columns
- As a Data Analyst, I want to convert the Date_Time column to utilize Pandasâ€™ DateTime data type
- As a Data Analyst, I want to visualize the frequency of different UFO shapes to determine which UFO shapes are most commonly encountered
    I will use a Matplotlib bar graph to visualize this data
    I will include a label for the X and Y axis
    I will include a name for my chart
- As a Data Analyst, I want to visualize the number of UFO encounters, grouped by each decade, to see if there are any trends between number of encounters and decade
    I will use a Matplotlib bar graph to visualize this data
    I will include a label for the X and Y axis
    I will include a name for my chart
- As a Data Analyst, I want to create a Line Graph to visualize the Frequency of UFO sightings, by hour of the day
    I will use a Matplotlib line graph to visualize this data
    I will include a label for the X and Y axis
    I will include a name for my chart
- As a Data Analyst, I want to answer all questions to provide a clear and detailed analysis of my UFO sighting findings
    * Which UFO shape is the most frequently reported?
    * Which shape is least frequently reported?
    * Based on your analysis, what times of the day have the highest number of UFO sightings?
    * Are there other factors that may account for this pattern in the data?
    * Do you see any surprising trends in the breakdown by decade?  Do you have any theories or ideas that may explain these patterns?
    * Based on your data analysis, what recommendation would you give to individuals interested in encountering a UFO? For example, what time would be best to look, what shapes should they expect to see, etc.

# Bonus Stories
- As a Data Analyst, I want to visualize the frequency of different UFO shape sightings for Virginia, Wisconsin, and Tennessee, to see if there is any variation of UFO shape frequency between states
    I will use a Matplotlib grouped bar graph to visualize this data
    I will include a label for the X and Y axis
    I will include a name for my chart
